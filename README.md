# 100 Days of Code
Participation repo for 100 Days of Code. I want to try and learn more about Rust, so this seems to fit nicely. I don't have any plans for what to do each day, some days I may just learn the Rust language and others I may attempt a small program. The rules are as follows below, however, I am participating privately, where I only show my progress in a dedicated Discord channel with other members.

## What is it?
100DOC is a challenge where you do programming for 100 days in a row, but is open for doing X (some hobby or new skill) for 100 days. There are two rules:
1. You must code for at least 1 hour per day
2. Tweet your progress every day

The official website is [here](https://www.100daysofcode.com/) for further information.

## Progress 
- [x] Day 1 - Simple multithreaded web server (From the Rust book)
- [ ] Day 2 - ?
