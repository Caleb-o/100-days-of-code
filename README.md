# 100 Days of Code
Participation repo for 100 Days of Code. I want to try and learn more about Rust, so this seems to fit nicely. I don't have any plans for what to do each day, some days I may just learn the Rust language and others I may attempt a small program. The rules are as follows below, however, I am participating privately, where I only show my progress in a dedicated Discord channel with other members.

## What is it?
100 DOC is a challenge where you code for 100 days in a row, but is open for doing X (some hobby or a new skill) for 100 days. There are two rules:
1. You must code for at least 1 hour per day
2. Tweet your progress every day

The official website is [here](https://www.100daysofcode.com/) to get for further information.

## Milestones
*Note: Milestones are based on rough estimates, some may be completed earlier or later depending on how days progress.*

- Day 25 : (small) SDL2 game of my own
